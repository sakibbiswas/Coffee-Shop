## Final notes


1. Replace `<YOUR NAME>` and `<YOUR EMAIL>` in README.md.
2. Add real images / screenshots into a `screenshots/` folder before zipping for submission.
3. The project uses `lucide-react` for icons and `react-scroll` for smooth scrolling.


Good luck — test responsiveness and theme persistence. If you want, I can generate a ready-to-download ZIP of these files or tailor the styles.```
